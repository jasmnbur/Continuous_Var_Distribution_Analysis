# Distribution Analysis (draft)
**ACS_dist_descriptions.py**
- Defines a function to analyze and visualize the distribution of a variable, x, in a specific dataframe, df. It requires pandas-readable data and a list of the variables you want to analyze from the data.
- I use household-level ACS PUMS data from 2019 for NY state, extracted from the U.S. Census' FTP server. Check the FTP server out [here](https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/data/pums/) and develop your own personalized analysis.

**HH_contvar_DistributionAnalysis.pdf**
- Provides a pdf report of the distribution analysis developed with added names of all the variables.
